\subsection{Experiment 1: Evaluation of Illumina TruSeq}

In our hands, the Illumina TruSeq protocol has performed extremely reliably with samples on the scale of ~100ng of total RNA.  However, attempts to create libraries from smaller samples yielded low complexity libraries, corresponding to approximately 30-fold PCR duplication of fragments. Anecdotally, less than 5\% of libraries made with at least 90ng of total RNA yielded abnormally low concentrations, which we observed correlated with low complexity (Data not shown). To determine the lower limit of input needed to reliably produce libraries, we attempted to make libraries from 40, 50, 60, 70, and 80 ng of {\em Drosophila} total RNA, each in triplicate.

\subsection{Experiment 2: Competitive Comparison of Low-volume RNA protocols}

We first sought to determine whether the low-volume RNAseq protocols available faithfully recapitulate linear changes in abundance of known inputs. We generated synthetic spike-ins by combining {\em D. melanogaster} and {\em D. virilis} total RNA in known, predefined proportions of 0, 5, 10, and 20\% {\em D. virilis} RNA. For each of the low-volume protocols, we used 1ng of total RNA as input, whereas for the TruSeq protocol we used 100ng.

The different protocols had a variation in yield of libraries from between 6 fmole (approximately 3.6 trillion molecules) and 2,400 femtomoles, with the TruSeq a clear outlier at the high end of the range, and the other protocols all below 200 fmole \ref{tab:round1protocols}.  Due to a pooling error, we generated significantly more reads than intended for the TruSeq protocol, and correspondingly fewer in the other protocols. Unless otherwise noted, we therefore sub-sampled the mapped reads to the lowest number of total reads in order to provide a fair comparison between protocols. 


\subsection{Experiment 3: Further modifications to the SMART-seq2 protocol}

Although the SMART-seq2 was the cheapest of the protocols, we wondered whether it could be performed more even more cheaply without compromising data quality.  This would enable us to include more biological replicates in subsequent experiments.  In the original protocol, we noticed that roughly 60\% of the cost came from the Nextera XT reagents.  Thus, this seemed to be the most productive point to target.
