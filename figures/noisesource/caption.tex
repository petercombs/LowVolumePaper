\label{fig:noisesource} \textbf{Estimating the source of preamplification noise}.  Plotted are the estimated slopes for each of the 3 samples.  The $2.5\times$ and $5\times$ dilution samples used the same preamplified cDNA, but different tagmentation reactions, whereas the Full Size sample used different preamplification and tagmentation reactions.
