\label{fig:fithists} \textbf{Comparison of linearity between different RNA-seq protocols}.  A) Normalized levels of gene expression $\hat{A}$ across samples using the TruSeq protocol, where each line is for a different gene.  B-E) Distributions of slopes, intercepts, and correlation coefficient for linear regressions of the data, as in panel A.
